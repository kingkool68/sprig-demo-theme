# Sprig Demo Theme

This is a simple demo theme to demonstrate how to use [Sprig](https://github.com/kingkool68/sprig) with a WordPress theme. Sprig is a plugin that enables the [Twig templating engine](https://twig.symfony.com/) with a WordPress twist.

## Styleguide
This theme includes a styleguide at `/styleguide/` with various components that can be viewed in one central location. This makes visually QAing a component much easier compared to finding an example of a problem in the database.

## Installing

Download and add this theme to the `themes` directory of your WordPress site. Also download and activate the [Sprig](https://github.com/kingkool68/sprig) WordPress plugin and add it to your `plugins` directory. It is also recommended to download and install the [WP Styleguide](https://github.com/kingkool68/wp-styleguide) plugin to see the styleguide content on the frontend.

The `import.xml` file can be used with the [WordPress Importer plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) to load up sample content suitable for testing a theme's capabilities. See the [Theme Unit Test repo](https://github.com/WPTRT/theme-unit-test) for more details.
